In US, New York State became one of the hotspots that had high daily new infection cases (increasing in an alarming rate) due to New York’s dense population and the shortage of supplies. The pandemic was unexpected, and many combat tactics were developed and implemented on the spot.A full understanding of its spreading behavior is crucial to develop measures to better prepare for future pandemics. However, the spread of pandemic is a complex, stochastic, and unpredictable process that involves numerous factors. Understanding this pandemic on a global scale can be challenging. Therefore, this research focuses solely on the New York State. We aim to understand the best COVID-19 spread measurement metrics, how it spread in terms of geo-location, identify the number of waves from the start of COVID-19 to the end of 2022, and how number of waves varies based on county. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Our research aims to understand COVID-19’s behavior in the New York State. Specifically, we want to first identify the best measurement metrics that reflects COVID-19 spread, through comparative analysis. Possile candidates include “daily new positives”, “cumulative number of positives”, “test % positive”, etc. Next, we want to visualize how COVID-19 spread in terms of geo-location through spatial graphs. Finally, we want to use time series graphs to identify the number of waves from the start of COVID-19 to the end of 2022, and how number of waves varies based on county. 2.2 Data availability For this project, we will draw from two data sources. The first, located at https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e is data collected by the New York state government health department. It contains COVID testing information since March 2020 across all 62 counties in New York state, and contains up until December 13th 2022 at the time of download. It’s easily downloadble as a .csv, and is already pretty clean. More information is presented in chapter 3. The second dataset we will use is latitude and longitude of all counties in the USA (of which we’ll only use the NY-based ones). It is held at https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/urbnmapr and more info can be found at https://urban-institute.medium.com/how-to-create-state-and-county-maps-easily-in-r-577d29300bb2 . It is created by a Washington D.C.-based think tank called Urban Institute, and is used pretty frequently. Therefore, it’s already quite clean. More information is presented in chapter 3. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources In this project, we used two data sources. We firstly used COVID testing information provided by the New York state government health department, located at: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e . It contains COVID testing information since March 2020 across all 62 counties in New York state, and contains up until December 13th 2022 at the time of download. It’s easily downloadble as a .csv, and is very clean. We chose this dataset over others because of its good upkeep, and New York’s role as both a staple of COVID health regulations over the pandemic, and also as it is close to home (as Columbia students). The second dataset we used was from the Urban Institute, and was not so much a dataset as it was a pre-defined co-ordinate system. Itcontains latitude and longitude information of all counties in all states across the US. It exists almost entirely to be used for map-plotting, which is a large purpose of Urban Institute. It can be found at https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/urbnmapr with more info at https://urban-institute.medium.com/how-to-create-state-and-county-maps-easily-in-r-577d29300bb2 . 3.2 Cleaning / transformation The columns in the NY Health dataset are: “Test Date”, “County”, “New Positives”, “Cumulative Number of Positives”, “Total Number of Tests Performed”, Cumulative Number of Tests Performed”, “Test % Positive”, and “Geography”. The cleaning and pre-processing steps were pretty minimal due to the data being updated regularly and maintained well. They were as follows: * Replace whitespaces with underscores in column names (e.g. “Test Date” -&gt; “Test_Date”) * Replace the “%” sign with “pct” in the column name: “Test % Positive” -&gt; “Test_pct_Positive” * Change “Test_Date” column type from string into date * Change “Test % Positive” column type from string into double (making sure to remove the trailing “%” sign) As the Urban Institute dataset exists almost entirely to be used for map-plotting (which is a large purpose of Urban Institute), there was hardly any cleaning required. However, there was one small point we had to address. In order to combine this map data for plotting with our COVID testing data, we had to perform a join on the name of the county. However, in the Urban Institute dataset, counties are named with a trailing ” County” on the end. For example, “Albany” is listed as a county in the NY gov dataset, but its corresponding entry in the Urban Institute dataset is “Albany County”. Thus, for compatibility we had to clean the Urban Institute dataset by removing all instances of ” County” and replacing it with an empty string. 3.3 Missing value analysis Neither dataset was missing any entries. This can be seen in the animations in the Results section, which show the entirety of the NY Health dataset plotted over all given dates, in all given counties. There are no empty frames (which would correspond to empty rows in the NY health dataset), and there are no missing counties or faulty co-ordinate locations (which would correspond to empty or incorrect rows in the Urban Institute dataset). "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results First, we want to determine the best measurement metrics for pandemic spread. From the dataset, we have three metrics to choose from: “New Positives”, “Cumulative Number of Positives”, “Test % Positive”. During the pandemic, people and media often use number of new cases each day to reflect the severity of the pandemic, but we suspect daily new cases is not an accurate metrics, due to its potential correlation to the number of tests performed each day. With more tests performed, more new cases would be discovered and documented. At the start of the pandemic, the shortage of supplies and immature pandemic combat tactics were very likely to result in a low number of testing performed. Therefore, we hypothesize “Test % Positive” is a better metrics that reflect the pandemic spread, in contrary to what most people perceive. Moreoever, “New Positives” and “Total Number of Tests Performed” have a positive correlation. See below for the cleaned dataset. There are no missing values, and we converted the “Test Date” column to date type, “Test % Positive” to double. We also converted all multi-word column titles to have an underscore “” instead of a whitespace, to maintain best coding practices. On top of this, we also converted the percentage sign in “Test%_Positive” to be the word “pct”, so the column became “Test_pct_Positive”. ## # A tibble: 74,314 × 8 ## Test_Date County New_Positives Cumulative_Number_of_Positives Total_Number_of_Tests_Performed Cumulative_Number_of_Te…¹ Test_…² Geogr…³ ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2022-12-13 Albany 50 76182 596 1414357 7.33 COUNTY ## 2 2022-12-13 Allegany 5 10479 77 250537 6.15 COUNTY ## 3 2022-12-13 Bronx 518 489863 5272 8960600 8.78 COUNTY ## 4 2022-12-13 Broome 38 56828 684 1194076 5.78 COUNTY ## 5 2022-12-13 Capital Region 194 275880 2448 5303110 7.42 REGION ## 6 2022-12-13 Cattaraugus 11 18742 154 309815 10.5 COUNTY ## 7 2022-12-13 Cayuga 6 19791 262 399588 2.17 COUNTY ## 8 2022-12-13 Central New York 88 221165 2444 4442412 3.7 REGION ## 9 2022-12-13 Chautauqua 9 28555 186 532991 3.95 COUNTY ## 10 2022-12-13 Chemung 15 26049 466 488383 4.84 COUNTY ## # … with 74,304 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​Cumulative_Number_of_Tests_Performed, ²​Test_pct_Positive, ³​Geography The below scatter graph gives an overview the correlation between Number of Tests Performed and New Positives on a county level.From the graph, we can distinctly see that there is much more data for New York City and Statewide. This results in dots concentrating together for scatterplots for other counties. Therefore, we decide to look at New York City and Statewide individually first, to see if there exsits a correlation between New Positives and Total number of tests.The graphs shows a strong positive relationship between the two. This provides evidence to our hypothesis that daily new cases is influenced by number of tests, therefore it is a biased metrics to measure the pandemic spread. To see if the above finding is true for other counties, we use a parallel coordinate plot. After we filtered out NYC and statewide, we noticed a few extreme outliers that negatively impacts the visibility of the majority of data. We decided to remove those outliers using the IQR method. We further sampled 100 rows of data for clearer visualization. In the resulting parallel corrdinate plot, we noticed the majority of lines are parallel to each other, shooting upwards. This adds more evidence that daily new cases is influenced by number of tests in other counties as well. In following two time series graph shows how New Positives and Number of Tests Performed changes overtime, with loess smoothing curves. We can clearly see that since the beginning of COVID-19, the number of tests performed gradually increases overtime and peaks at 2022. One explanation for this is there was a severe shortage of supplies and medical staffs at first. Interestingly, New Positives follows a similar trend: slowly increasing at first, and peaks at 2022. This again demonstrates the what New Cases are measuring may not truly be the daily new cases, but the cases identified through testing. In conclusion, we decide to use “Test % Positive” as the pandemic spread measurement metrics for the remaining of this research. This metric eliminates the bias introduced by the number of tests and can more accurately reflect the pandemic spread. So, now that we have found our appropriate metric for measuring COVID spread, we might begin to attempt to answer our more explorative questions. That is, how does COVID spread geographically, how many waves has New York state experienced, and do these waves differ by location? To tackle these questions, we can examine time series plots of how the Test % Positive rate has changed over time. We can overlay multiple different counties together to examine results. To start, let’s use NYC and the Bronx to get an initial answer. We’ll also compute 3-day and 7-day rolling averages for the positive test rate (for stability purposes), and display them in a similar manner. These plots are shown below. NYC and the Bronx are geographically adjacent, and as such we might expect their COVID spread over time to be extremely similar - which is verified by our results. Based on the above plots, we may be willing to conclude that there are 3 waves, two of which being major. The first occurring at the beginning of 2020, the beginning of our COVID testing data collection period, a minor wave in late 2020 to early 2021, and another severe wave starting at the latter end of 2021. However, we haven’t yet asked whether this is true across the entirety of New York State. We can create a similar plot, but including a comparison to two far-away counties: Erie (far West) and Franklin (far North). Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we can see that while the positive test rate in Franklin mimics that of NYC somewhat closely, and yet there is a large discrepancy in Erie in early-mid 2022 - immediately after the 2nd major wave in NYC. So, it is clear that just using data from NYC may not be representative of the entire state. Instead, it allows us to form a reasonable first guess as to when the waves might have occurred, but more analysis is required to make any conclusions on a county-by-county basis. We’ll aim to do this by creating heatmaps overlayed onto a map of New York state, on which we will be able to get a better sense of how COVID spreads geographically. To start with, we’ll pick a somewhat arbitrary date at the beginning of 2022, and show our results. As can be seen, on any given day, it is very possible that positive test rate differs quite highly depending on where you are within NY state. In order to get a better sense of how these rates develop over time, we’ll generate an animated plot over the time in which we have data. We can see that despite small, isolated instances of COVID outbreaks at various points, our hypothesis of when the waves occur based on the NYC time series plot seems to be mostly accurate. That is, (of course, beyond the initial outbreak) one smaller wave beginning at the tail end of 2020 and a large wave at the end of 2021. To get a better sense of those two instances, we’ll also created animated plots over those two time frames, shown below. Another qualitative piece of information that we can see from these two animations is the geography-based nature of the spread of COVID cases. In both instances, we see surges originating in localised areas followed by a subsequent burst of cases in the surrounding areas which rapidly spread state-wide. In conclusion "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion In conclusion, we sought out to answer some fundamental exploratory questions about COVID spread in New York State. For example, we asked: “How many waves of COVID did New York experience and when did they occur?” and “What is the nature of the geographic spread of COVID in New York, do nearby counties tend to have more correlated cases than ones which are further away?”. We found that the appropriate metric to use for such answers was the percentage of positive test cases each day, since it inherently normalises for number of tests taken. This is not true for the raw number of positive tests, because it was strongly linked to number of tests taken (and is therefore biased towards counties with higher numbers of tests). We found that beyond the initial COVID outbreak, there were 2 main waves: One mild which occurred at the end of 2020, and another more severe wave which spiked drastically around the 2022 new year. We also noted that within New York state, COVID spread roughly locally. That is, counties closer together tended to have more temporally-related case spread, whereas counties that are further apart were less correlated in this regard. For further exploration of this topic, we may like to consider other states and create similar plots examining counties across the whole country. This question would be very interesting, but would require significantly more effort due to the nature of different data sources required for each state.
